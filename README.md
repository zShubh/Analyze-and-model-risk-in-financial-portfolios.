# Stock Market Analysis and ARIMA Time Series Prediction.
Analyzed stock markets and developed ARIMA models to predict future prices for Tesla and Microsoft, improving market movement forecasting. Prepared and normalized data using Python libraries, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.


This project involves comprehensive stock market analysis and the application of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models to predict future stock prices for Tesla and Microsoft. The goal is to enhance the ability to anticipate market movements and make accurate and reliable predictions.

#Notebook Overview
In this notebook, we will perform the following steps:

Importing Libraries

We will start by importing necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and others required for data preprocessing and analysis.
Preprocessing

The stock market data will be prepared and normalized to ensure accurate predictions. This includes handling missing data, scaling features, and formatting the data for analysis.
Tesla Stock Market Analysis

A detailed analysis of Tesla's stock market data will be conducted to understand its historical performance and identify patterns.
Tesla ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) Time Series Prediction

ARIMA models will be applied to Tesla's historical data to predict future stock prices, enhancing the ability to anticipate Tesla's market movements.
Microsoft Stock Market Analysis

A similar analysis will be conducted for Microsoft, focusing on its historical stock market data.
Microsoft ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) Time Series Prediction

ARIMA models will also be applied to Microsoft's historical data to predict future stock prices, providing insights into Microsoft's potential market trends.
